            <h3>My Favorite Chocolate Cupcakes with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>

            <header>Life is sweeter with cupcakes!</header>
                <p>This recipe evolved over the years from a cake recipe I found in an old cookbook.<br> The recipe was called "Wacky Cake" because it's a bit untraditional: no eggs are needed, and all the ingredients are stirred together at once.<br>
                Somehow, it makes the world's best chocolate cake, with a flavor and consistency reminiscent of a Hostess cupcake.</p>
                <p>Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting was a random find in another cookbook. It's like regular frosting turned up a notch. And it pairs perfectly with these cupcakes!</p>
                <p>I can almost guarantee that you'll have all the supplies already on hand. Here are the ingredients you will need... let's get started!</p>
                <h4>For 12 cupcakes:</h4>

                    </ul>
                <h4>Directions:</h4>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.</p>
                    <p>For the cupcakes: stir together the first 5 ingredients. Once fully incorporated, stir in the last 4 ingredients.</p>
                    <p>Portion batter evenly into prepared muffin tin. Bake 18-20 minutes, just until tops spring back when pressed.<br>
                    Don't overbake!</p>
                    <p>Cool in pan for 5 minutes, then remove to finish cooling on a wire rack.</p>
                    <p>For the frosting: Using an electric mixer, whip butter and cream cheese together until fully incorporated.<br>
                    Mix in cocoa powder and powdered sugar. Beat until well mixed. Mix in vanilla and a dash of salt.<br>
                    Continue beating until frosting is of spreadable consistency.</p>
                    <p>Frost cooled cupcakes. Add sprinkles if desired!</p>
